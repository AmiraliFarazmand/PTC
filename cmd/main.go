/*
Hereâ€™s my program logic. Design a Camunda BPMN diagram for it. Underestand what it realy do it contains some authentication methods, a purchase process and a payment which is mocked . name each step clearly. Return the BPMN XML or a diagram I can import into Camunda Modeler.
Here is the summary presudure of the purchase process:
- Authenticated user submits a post request contains amount and address
- A put request comes into an endpoint contains purchase_id and system changes its status; if in a given time like 10 minutes the created purchase didn't paid system should canel it automatically
- END
Please return the BPMN in XML format that I can import into Camunda Modeler
